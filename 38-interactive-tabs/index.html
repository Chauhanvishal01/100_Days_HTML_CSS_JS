            HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your
            content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to
            enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
            certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a
            word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can
            make the font bigger or smaller, and so on
          </p>

          <h1>CSS</h1>
          <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply
            designed language intended to simplify the process of making web
            pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More
            importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML
            that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look:
            it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more.

          <h1>JavaScript</h1>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and
            interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the
            scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the
            development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use
            it. JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed).
            JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as
            Server-side developments.

            Currently, ReactJS is one of the most popular JavaScript front-end
            libraries which has a strong foundation and a large community.
            ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library
            for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source,
            component-based front end library which is responsible only for the
            view layer of the application. It was initially developed and
            maintained by Facebook and later used in its products like WhatsApp
            & Instagram.

          <p>
            Node JS is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for
            executing JavaScript code outside a browser. NodeJS is not a
            framework and it’s not a programming language. Node.js is used to
            build back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It’s
            used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix,
            Walmart, and so on.
